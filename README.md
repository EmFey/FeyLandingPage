# FeyLandingPage
This project is a basic landing page for modern websites. My goal was to test my CSS skills with flexbox and several other things.
The main technologies I used were VS code and Google Chrome to test the results.
It was challeng at first with putting everything exactly where they're supposed to be but in the future, I will make it work with mobile phones as well.
