            <h2>Welcome to the Y arts</h2>
            <p>Many are not aware of what Y arts even is. To be honest, I'm not quite sure yet. Y'know what, I can actually make a brand out of this. It sounds so mysterious too... Like Fey... But I'm sure you'll like the arts too.</p>

        <p>monochrome image of a tree, seems to be silhouetted but it may just be something else.</p>
        <img src="images/Leaders.jpg" alt="paper boats">
        <p>red as dominant as a color can be. Theres only one leader</p>
        <img src="images/yellowScratch.jpg" alt="a pinch of yellow">
        <p>monochrome seems to be the overall theme of Y. Thats why a pinch of yellow looks like a masterpiece</p>
